Summary
* Master of Science in Biochemistry, specializing in Cellular and Molecular Biology with 4 years of research
experience.
* Excellent tissue culture and aseptic techniques honed through 4 years of hands-on experience working with
various mammalian and human cell lines.
* One year experience working in a cGMP environment at Microbix Biosystems Inc. focused on tissue culture,
viral infection, harvesting and processing of viral antigens.
*
One year of experience in microbiology working on bacterial culture to express different proteins.
* Deep knowledge and practical experience in synthesizing, analyzing and purifying proteins and DNA: gel
electrophoresis, immunostaining, Western Blots, PCR, RNA extraction, RT-PCR.
* Knowledge of a broad spectrum of other biochemistry techniques (ELISA, flowcytometry)
• Thorough understanding of WHMIS, GLP and cGMP.

* Performed screens and validations for different kinase inhibitors/drugs using different methods such as
Western Blot and Ussing chamber using MDCK cells and #F508/ #F508 CF patient lung tissue.
* Established working protocol for culturing MDCK cells expressing #F508-CFTR on inserts with
permeable membrane and testing cells on Ussing chamber.
* Acquired 3 years of experience in cell culture working with various cell lines (MDCK, HEK293) and
techniques used in analyzing protein and DNA (Western Blot, ELISA, PCR, qPCR, RT-PCR)
* Experienced in performing qPCR to quantify the degree of knock down of target genes.
* Initiated the screen for chaperones that were involved in the rescue of #F508-CFTR by the indentified
kinase inhibitors using qPCR array.
* Publication: Use of kinase inhibitors to correct #F508-CFTR function. A. Trzcinska-Daneluti, L. Nguyen et
al (2012) Molecular and Cellular Proteomics, 11(9): 745-757.
Summer Intern at The Hospital for Sick Children
May 2009 - September 2009 (5 months)
• Generated DNA constructs and purified the two unique middle and N-terminal domains of dNedd4L fused
with GST tag through bacterial expression.
• Examined the inhibitor effect of these two domains on the Hect domain of dNedd4L by conducting in vitro
binding and ubiquitination assays
• Validated four possible substrate of dNedd4L by performing in vitro binding assays with the corresponding
GST-tagged Middle or N-terminal domain.
• Deep knowledge in microbiology techniques with one year of experience working with bacterial culture
(PCR, RT-PCR DNA digestion, bacterial expression of protein, column chromatography for the purfication
of protein, miniprep, maxiprep for DNA preparation)
• Publication: A Splice Isoform of DNedd4, DNedd4-Long, Negatively Regulates Neuromuscular
