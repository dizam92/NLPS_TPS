Experience
Postdoc at University of Guelph
January 2010 - Present (6 years 11 months)
In 2010, I joined Dr. Joseph Lam's lab to work on the human oportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
more specifically, on the important virulence factor lipopolysaccharide. In 2011, I obained the cystic fibrosis
canada (CFC) postdoctral fellowship to continue work on the biosynthesis, structure and function of the
common polysaccharide antigen (CPA) of P. aeruginosa. In 2014, the fellowship is renewed for another year.
I am currently performing biofilm studies of different P. aeruginosa LPS mutants as well as characterizing
the functions and structures of some enzymes involved in CPA biosynthesis.
