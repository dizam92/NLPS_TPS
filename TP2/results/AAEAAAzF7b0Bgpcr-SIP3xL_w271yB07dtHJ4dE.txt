This doctoral dissertation longitudinally examines the risks of developing chronic conditions over time,
and the associations between risk factors among immigrant and refugee populations in Canada compared
to Canadian-born individuals using the linked population-based data sources described above. A scoping
review of best-practice evidence on immigration settlement in Canada (as well as comparable OCED
