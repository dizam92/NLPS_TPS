1 person has recommended Anky
"I worked with Anky as a Biostatistical Analyst at the British Columbia Cancer Agency for 1.5 years.
Although we did not work on any projects together, she was always kind and ready to help with any questions
that I had as I learned more about SAS programming and biostatistics. Anky delivered a presentation on
PROC TABULATE at the Vancouver SAS User Group (VanSUG), and it turned out to be one of the most
useful things that I learned in SAS. Her visual, step-by-step demonstration of this powerful procedure's
capabilities was very easy to understand, and her sample code proved to be a great time saver in my work.
I highly recommend SAS users to view that presentation on the VanSUG presentation archive. Anky was a
friendly and helpful co-worker who brought positivity to our office, and our team was sad but excited for her
as she departed for a new job in business analytics at Best Buy. She would be a valuable addition to any team
that seeks her qualifications. "
