Job description
The Challenge

Your ability to keep your eye on multiple moving parts makes you a top foreman/forewoman of the accounting variety. You've never shied away from wearing multiple hats and you excel at building relationships cross-functionally. In this blended role, you'll be responsible for the month/quarter/year-end close, assist with the annual budgeting process, as well as the re-forecasts and budgets to actual variance analysis. You'll use your business partnering skills to add value to the sales team by providing them with reporting, analysis and commentary on sales results. Your background in manufacturing is a highly desirable trait (though not a must-have) and will aid you in working with the Controller on product costing, run labor and material efficiency. You're the CPA who is a top caliber foreman/forewoman and we want to talk to you.

Responsibilities
Month-End and Day-to-Day Accounting
You'll be responsible for the preparation of monthly financial statements, as well the day-to-day accounting duties.
